          <h1>Software Developer</h1>

          <p>Do you…</p>

          <p>Want to work for a startup that is innovating the healthcare industry? Do you want to work on interesting technologies such as Angular.js, d3.js, Python, ElasticSearch and MongoDB?</p>

          <p>CTcue in Amsterdam is looking for a software developer.</p>

          <h2>Company profile</h2>

          <p>We are a start-up team with 4 developers and a ‘hustler’ with different expertises and backgrounds.  Because we are highly successful at this moment, we are looking for more talented employees who are as excited as us about realizing the right stuff. Some examples of technologies we are working with are: Node.js, Angular.js, D3.js, Python, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB, neo4j.</p>

          <p>Our head office is located at the Science Park in Amsterdam (within the incubator Ace Venture Lab) and we are getting started in Birmingham UK. We have close connections to the Amsterdam universities, we work with professors and researchers in the field of information retrieval, Artificial Intelligence and Medical Informatics.</p>

          <p>Introducing technical innovation in hospitals can be a challenge, we know. But we have done this so often that we know who to talk to and when. Even before implementation, we will accompany during talks and we will handle all the technical meetings. Next to technology we are fast becoming experts on medical data privacy laws. The CTcue platform searches on anonymized patient data and runs exclusively within the hospital's environment. Patient data will always be save. 70% of health data is entered as text into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and their potential remains mostly unused. </p>

          <h2>Daily tasks</h2> 

          <ul>
            <li>Tuesday team meetings, your commitment what to deliver next week;</li>
            <li>Research best approaches;</li>
            <li>Developing stuff; </li>

            <li>Afternoon drinks with beer and jokes;</li>
            <li>Hourly Slack workout bot.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Desired skills</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>You are always open to new approaches and solutions;</li>
            <li>Ideally you just graduated and have a master’s degree in e.g. Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence;</li>
            <li>You like to make a difference and an impact in health care;</li>
            <li>Experience with Node.js, Angular.js, D3.js, Python, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, machine learning and natural language processing would be great, but eagerness to learn is essential;</li>
            <li>The startup DNA is in our blood, which means that we are hands-on and proactive. Own input is not only appreciated, it is required!</li>
