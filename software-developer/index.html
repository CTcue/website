          <h2>Company profile</h2>

          <p>70% of health data is entered as text into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and their potential remains mostly unused. Manually searching for patients against quality and study criteria remains a major hurdle and adds immensely to the burden of hospitals. Using information retrieval, natural language processing and AI technologies CTcue unlocks the value of this health data.</p>

          <p>We are a start-up team of 9 with 8 developers with different expertises and backgrounds. The success of our company now allows us to search for more smart people who are excited about realizing the right stuff. Some examples of technology we work with are: Node.js, Angular.js, D3.js, Python, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB, neo4j.</p>

          <p>Our office is at the Science Park in Amsterdam. We have close connections to the Amsterdam Universities, we work with professors and researchers in the field of information retrieval, Artificial Intelligence and Medical Informatics.</p>

          <h2>Your profile</h2> 

          <ul>
            <li>You are always open to new approaches and solutions.</li>
            <li>Ideally you just graduated as master in e.g. Computer Science</li>
            <li>You like to make a difference and an impact in health care</li>
            <li> Experience with Node.js, Angular.js, D3.js, Python, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, machine learning and    natural language processing would be great, but eagerness to learn is essential</li>
          </ul>
