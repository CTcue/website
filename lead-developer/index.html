We have close connections to the Amsterdam universities, we work with professors and researchers in the field of information retrieval, Artificial Intelligence and Medical Informatics.</p>

          <p>CTcue is a scale-up. We’re currently working for 8 hospitals, but we expect that number to grow to 30 in 2017. Because we are highly successful at the moment, we are looking for more talented developers who are as excited about realizing innovations in the healthcare sector as we are.</p>

            <li>Experience with/interest in developing SaaS solutions</li>
